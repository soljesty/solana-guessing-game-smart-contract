How to set up a Cloud Compute Environment and Deploy This Smart Contract from Scratch:
Example follows setup of an Ubuntu EC2 or Vast.ai machine

# Start by updating and upgrading the system
echo "Updating and upgrading the system..."
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Modify the environment file
sudo nano /etc/environment
Comment out keys that start with ‘AAA’

# Install prerequisites
echo "Installing Python 3, pip, Git, and other essentials..."
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git curl build-essential

# Update system and install dependencies (nano, git)
echo "Updating system and installing dependencies..."
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nano git curl

# Install Rust
echo "Installing Rust..."
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y

# Source the Rust environment to make rustc available in the current session
echo "Setting up Rust environment..."
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Install Rustc
rustup install 1.79.0
rustup default 1.79.0
rustup override set 1.79.0

# Install Solana:
echo "Installing Solana…"
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/v2.1.5/install)" 

# Add Solana to PATH:
echo "Adding Solana to PATH..."
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Seed Phrase Recovery:
# In order to recovery your key, you will need to enter your 12 word recovery phrase. This will
# not be visible when entering it – I recommend typing it in a text file and pasting it in to prevent error
solana-keygen recover "prompt://?key=0/0" --outfile ~/my-solana-keypair.json

# Location of Keypair File:
/root/my-solana-keypair.json

# Set Solana Wallet:
solana config set --keypair /root/my-solana-keypair.json

# Fund Wallet if Needed:
solana airdrop 2 --url https://api.devnet.solana.com 



# Create Smart Contract Project:
cargo new --lib solana-smart-contract
cd solana-smart-contract

# Copy Smart Contract code to the lib.rs file

# Toml file:
[package]
name = "solana-smart-contract"
version = "0.1.0" 
authors = ["Andrew Foudree afoudree@gmail.com"] 
edition = "2018" 

[dependencies] 
solana-program = "1.14.17"
borsh = "0.9.1"
#solana-cargo-build-sbf = "1.79.0"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"] # This is important for Solana's runtime to load the contract

# To Verify Build Rustc Versions:
rustc --version
cargo build-sbf --version 

# Build Solana Smart Contract:
cargo build-sbf

solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# solana program deploy ~/solana_smart_contract/target/deploy/solana_smart_contract.so --keypair ~/my-solana-keypair.json

** MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT PATH TO SMART CONTRACT **
** MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FUNDED YOUR WALLET WITH DEVSOL FROM THE FAUCET **
